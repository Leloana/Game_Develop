![Godot Logo](images/godot-logo.svg)

Welcome to my repository! This is a collection of projects developed as part of the **PET (Programa de EducaÃ§Ã£o Tutorial) ComputaÃ§Ã£o e Design** initiative at my university. The focus of this project is to create an **introductory course on game development using the Godot Engine**, targeting students interested in learning game development from scratch.

## About the Project

This repository is part of the **PET ComputaÃ§Ã£o e Design** initiative aimed at creating educational content to teach game development using the **Godot Engine**. Here, you'll find a variety of game projects, tutorials, and prototypes developed as part of the course preparation. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience for students interested in game design and programming.

## Projects

Below is a list of key projects included in this repository:

1. **Dodge The Creeps 2D**
   - Basic mechanics such as character movement, collision detection, basic of UI and enemy AI.

2. **Dodge The Creeps 3D**
   - Basic mechanics such as character movement, collision detection, basic of UI and enemy AI, but in 3D.


## Technologies

- **Languages**: GDScript
- **Engine**: Godot (version 4.0+)
- **Tools**: Git, Blender (for optional 3D modeling)
- **Assets**: Free and open-source resources from the Godot Asset Library and others
